# computer_vision_image_identification
The objective of this project is to check if a picture contains your favorite pet or not. The task
involves binary classification, where the model determines whether the pet is present or
absent in the given image.
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves categorizing
images into different classes. It finds applications in various domains such as object
recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to
capture local patterns and hierarchical representations from image data
